/*GDT stands for "Global Descriptor Table".
It is a table available on i386 (ix86?)
processors. The GDT is a list of 64 bit entries.
GRUB (or our boot) loader will install the GDT for us.
If we overwrite the GDT we will cause a 'triple fault'
and the machine will be reset.
Based on the tutorial, we will write a GDT with only 3 fields
and will not concern ourselves with the other fields.
The above was paraphrased from:
